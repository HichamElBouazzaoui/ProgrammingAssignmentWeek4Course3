## Codebook for Assignment of Course 3 Week 4
This codebook descripes the meaning of the variables in the tidy_totaldataset.txt and tidy_totaldataset_averages.txt

The experiment has been carried out by 30 volunteers each performing 6 activities.

The data is obtained from the website given on the coursera course assignment website. The website contains data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S
smartphone. 

The script generates two output files, namely "tidy_totaldataset.txt"  and "tidy_totaldataset_averages.txt" where the following desciption is given for the different variables:

- DataActivity
This column represents the activity carried out by the volunteers, which consists of the following:
WALKING 		= 1
WALKING_UPSTAIRS 	= 2
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 	= 3
SITTING 		= 4 
STANDING 		= 5 
LAYING 			= 6

- DataSubject
This column represents the volounteer who carried out the experiment and runs from 1 to 30, whihc is the number of volunteers.

- FeatureLabels
the variables are values of the mean and standard deviation of the input data set. Each feature for one of the axial linear acceleration or angular velocities is captured both in the 
time and frequency domain and is denoted as a prefix of"time" or "freq" for each feature. 

The output that is generated by the script is a tidy dataset with the following names:
tidy_totaldataset.txt
tidy_totaldataset_average
